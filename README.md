# Machine Learning Project

This project focuses on predicting bank customer churn using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes features such as credit score, age, balance, and account activity. After data preprocessing, models were trained to identify patterns that contribute to customer attrition. The goal is to help banks proactively retain customers by understanding churn behavior.
